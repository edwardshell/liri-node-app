# liri-node-app

Liri node app is almost like Siri but used through the command line in the terminal.


To be able to use liri node app open the java code in your editor and use liri through the terminal command lines.

This was all possible by using Spotify, Request, Twitter, and Dotenv npm packages.


Commands:

node liri my-tweets: this command will show you all my latest tweets. Since I only made a twitter for this homework there arent to many tweets...

node liri movie-this "movie name": this command will return movie information through the OMDB API on the movie you provide

node liri spotify-this-song "song name": this command will return the song information on the song you provide through the SPotify API

node liri do-what-it-says: this command will take in the information in the random.txt file and will spotify-this-song for Backstreet Boys "I want it that way", a certified jam.

# Troubles

This was the first time using swith cases, once understood it made it much easier to run all the methods for each command.

Also, understanding how to modify the information given on npm to work and return the needed information.
